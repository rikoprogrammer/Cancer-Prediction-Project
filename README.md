In this project i set out to use the Support Vector Machine to implement a classification algorithm.</br>
The data was obtained from the below source;</br>
(https://data.world/cancerdatahp/lung-cancer-data/workspace/file?filename=cancer+patient+level%20data+sets.xlsx) </br>
The goal of this project is to predict the level of risk of someone being diagonised with lung cancer. </br> 
There are three risk levels considered; low, medium and high.
